The institutional operating system for modern music legends. Sound Merge provides artists and labels with decentralized infrastructure for creative production, global distribution, and biometric rights protection.

## 🚀 Key Architectural Enhancements

### 1. Kling Cinema Forge (Advanced Video Synthesis)

### 2. Discovery Lab (Toolkit Matrix)
